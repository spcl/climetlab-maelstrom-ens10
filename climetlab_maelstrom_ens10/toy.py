    The ENS5-mini dataset is a smaller version of ENS10 (see description), which aims to facilitate understanding
    the data and training simple models. It consists of the same data as ENS10 - model output data of
    ECMWF "hindcast" experiments. These are ensemble forecasts with 5 ensemble members that are spread over 10
    years (1998-2007) with two forecasts per week, cropped to the region of Europe (40-60 degrees latitude,
    0-40 degrees longitude). The API of this dataset is designed to be equivalent to that of ENS10.

    The dataset is grouped by month (i.e., a single month contains all 10 years of predictions), where
    each forecast contains two steps: 0 and 24 hour lead time.
    To query the list of months, run `all_datelist` on the loaded dataset.

    In every file, there are 6 dimensions of data (in this order): `number` (ensemble member),
    `time` (year offset from 1998), `step` (forecast lead time, 0=0h, 1=24h),
    `isobaricInhPa` (pressure level), `latitude`, and `longitude`.
